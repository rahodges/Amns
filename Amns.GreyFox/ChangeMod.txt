Version 1.60 - August 12, 2004
*	Removed obsolete cache and index list classes.

	of the word "Saint" ("St.") into the word "Street".
Version 1.51 - April 23, 2004
*	Toolbars now render in a toolbar div tag so that window printer function can
	disable the printout of toolbars. A known bug is the blank space that prints
	in the toolbar row.

	print bug when tablewindow DIVs were not unscrolled before printing.

*	Updated GreyFoxContact.ConstructName() method to detect null values which
	previously caused exceptions.

	is now corrected. Performance is now enhanced with StringBuilder.
Version 1.1 - November 16, 2003

	events to desyncronize objects when the	children collection changes.

*	GreyFoxContat.ConstructName performance increased; calls a single
	EnsurePreLoad() method and uses private fields instead of properties to
	access name data.

*	Official release of Amns.GreyFox Core Assembly.
*	Classes now implement a syncronization detection feature. If properties
	are set to an existing value, syncronization will not change.
